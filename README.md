# OV Alerts to SNMP

The script alerts-to-snmp.ps1 matches OV alerts with SNMP OID trap generated
This is useful in the scenario where administrator wants to find OneView alerts that has SNMP OIID trap attached to it

## Prerequisites
The  script requires:
   * the latest OneView PowerShell library : https://github.com/HewlettPackard/POSH-HPOneView/releases
   * Optionally, you can install the module ImportExcel from the PowerShell gallery to take advantage of Excel functions 
     ** Use the command Install-module ImportExcel -scope CurrentUser 
   * A txt file containing list of OneView appliances name or IP


## Output
The script generates a CSV file containing: alertTypeID, alert description, SNMP OID and suggested corrective action 
The CSV file uses '|' as delimiter so if you want to view it correctly in Excel, you should use custom delimiter
Example
import-CSV -delimiter '|' file.csv | Out-GridView

if the ImportExcel module is installed, the script will generate Excel file.


## Syntax

```
   $cred    = get-credential   # Provide credential to connect to OneView

   * End   : get-date          --> today
   * Severity                  --> If not specified, only collect alerts with Severity = Critical and Warning
